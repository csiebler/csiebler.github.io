For the past years, I&rsquo;ve been hosting my former Wordpress site on a SaaS offering. Since it was prepaid for several years, I didn&rsquo;t worry too much about it and kept writing posts. However, just as our baby was born the new billing cycle started - but it was not setup to auto-renew. Since I was not actively using the original email account any more that I&rsquo;ve signed up with for the hosting, I forgot about it&mldr;and so it happened that I missed the renewal period, and my account was eventually deleted. Lesson learned, back to GitHub Pages!</p><p>I am hoping to re-write some of the most important posts over the coming weeks, if you have post suggestions, please reach out to me via <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/csiebler/>LinkedIn</a>.</p><p>Thanks,
