## Introduction

In this post we briefly discuss how [LlamaIndex ðŸ¦™ (GPT Index)](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and `gpt-35-turbo` (the model behind ChatGPT) can be used with [Azure OpenAI Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/openai-service).

If you want a short into to using Azure OpenAI Service with Llama-Index, have a look at this post: [posts/using-gpt-index-llamaindex-with-azure-openai-service/](/posts/using-gpt-index-llamaindex-with-azure-openai-service/)

## Tutorial

First, create a `.env` and add your Azure OpenAI Service details:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxx
OPENAI_API_BASE=https://xxxxxxxx.openai.azure.com/
OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-05-15
```

Next, make sure that you have `gpt-35-turbo` and `text-embedding-ada-002` deployed and used the same name as the model itself for the deployment.

Let's install/upgrade to the latest versions of `openai`, `langchain`, and `llama-index` via `pip`:
```
pip install openai --upgrade
pip install langchain --upgrade
pip install llama-index --upgrade
```

Here, we're using `openai==0.27.8`, `langchain==0.0.240`, and `llama-index==0.7.11.post1`.
