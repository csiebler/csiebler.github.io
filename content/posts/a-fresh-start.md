Hello world,

Some of you have been coming to this website to find help for Azure-related questions that weren't answered anywhere else on the web. Unfortunatly, most of this information is gone for good:

As some of you know, I've recently became a dad and my life turned upside down. For the past years, I've been hosting my former Wordpress site on a SaaS offering. Since it was prepaid for several years, I didn't worry too much about it and kept writing posts. However, just as our baby was born the new billing cycle started - but it was not setup to auto-renew. Since I was not actively using the original email account any more that I've signed up with for the hosting, I forgot about it...and so it happened that I missed the renewal period, and my account was eventually deleted. Lesson learned, back to GitHub Pages!

I am hoping to re-write some of the most important posts over the coming weeks, if you have post suggestions, please reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/csiebler/).

Thanks,
Clemens
