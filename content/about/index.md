I'm Clemens – I studied Computer Science at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany and spend a year researching at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. In my professional life I worked in several roles as a Software Engineer, Cloud Solution Architect, and also as a manager of a team of Solution Architects. Over the past couple of years, I've published multiple patents and research papers. I am currently working as a Specialist for AI & ML at Microsoft.

In my spare time I enjoy traveling and keeping up with the civil aviation industry, hiking up the Bavarian Alps, and last but not least, spend as much time as possible cooking in the kitchen.
